    "* User User CF: First CF technique created, the User User CF only takes into consideration only the user's past behaviour, *i.e.*, its ratings, and nothing about the items's characteristics. The ideia is pretty simple: If two users $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ have liked items $I_{a}$ and $I_{b}$, but user $U_{2}$ liked an item $I_{c}$ that $U_{1}$ hasn't seen yet. We infer that item $I_{c}$ would be a good recommendation for $U_{1}$. The following picture gives a good representation about it.\n",

    "* Item Item CF: The User User CF has some drawbacks, which we are going to talk about later. Because of these drawbacks, a more efficient approach was created, the Item Item CF. This technique doesn't take into consideration the users' similarities but only on item similarities. With this, new item predictions for a user $U$ can be easily calculated taking into account the ratings the user gave for similar items. This approach is going to be presented in the next notebook.\n",

    "# Nearest Neighboors for CF\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach for doing CF with nearest neighboors is to compare what you want to be matched with other similiar entities. With this, we have to define two things: \n",
    "  \n",
    "* One, in order to bring the most similar items or other customers with similar tastes, we must limit the amount of entities we compare it with.\n",
    "* Second, when doing predictions for an unseen data, we must match it with neighboors who have already rated the data we want.\n",
    "  \n",
    "With these two constraints, we see we have a trade off when deciding the amount of neighboors. If the number of neighboors is set to a too low value, the chances is that we end up with a lot of entities not having reviewed the same thing, and we end up not being able to provide confident predictions for our objective. If we set the bar too high, we will include too many different neighboors in our comparison, with different tastes than the user we want predict recommendations to.\n",
    "\n",
    "([Herlocker et all, 2002](https://grouplens.org/site-content/uploads/evaluating-TOIS-20041.pdf)) made a feel experiments with different configurations for User User CF and discovered that, for most commercial applications used nowadays, an optimal number of neighboors to consider is between 20 and 30.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In short, we have the following steps in a Nearest Neighboor CF:\n",
    "    - Starting from the User x Movie matrix, calculate the similarity between all users.\n",
    "    - For each user, filter the K most similar neighboors\n",
    "    - Predict new rating for user based on its nearest neighboors\n",

    "Now that we have all our most similar users, how can we predict unseen items to a user, *i.e.* predict the rating value for a item an user hasn't evaluated yet?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to predict it is to select all nearest neighboors $subset(N_{u})$ that have rated a specific item $i$ of interest and average them out to have a prediction. Of course, we want to consider one thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we select by the K nearest neighboors, we have different levels of similarity between users. As so, we want to users with bigger similarity to have more impact, *i.e.*, weight, in the average calculation. In one extreme, if there were only 5 users in the system sharing two product reviews and one of the them is completely unrelated to our user of interest, even though he is a 'neighboor', we want him to have a minimum weight in our average calculation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The way to do this is just an weighted average:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{k} r_{n}w_{n}}{\\sum_{n=1}^{k} w_{n}}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "The $r$ are the ratings of the neighboors **rated the item of interest** and $w$ are they similarity with the user of interest. The traditional arithmetic average is the weighted average with all $w$ = 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, just to make things easier, lets calculate the rating prediction for all possible movies. Of course, in a real scenario, you wouldn't calculate it as it would be a waste of processing power.\n"

    "        1. Calculating the User User similarity matrix: For a 100 x 25 matrix, my notebook (I7 with 16 GB RAM) already took a few seconds to process it. When we scale this size by million times, as in a real e-commerce store, this become unfeasible. Even worse when new users are registering and reviewing products every day.\n",
    "        2. User similarity doesn't hold for a long time. Users's taste is a research area on its own but in short we can summarise that the actual users' taste for online products can change quite quick. If the service wants to account for the costumer's short time interests, he should recalculate the entire User User matrix.\n",
    "        \n",
    "As we are going to see in the next notebook, Item Item CF adjust (a little) for these disadvantages above. Considering that Item Item similarity are more long term stable than a User User matrix, the Item Item CF allow us to calculate the similarity matrix offline and less often than User User."
